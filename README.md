# Corrections
Proposing corrections for CodeAbbey problem texts

**If you want to suggest correction** the most convenient way is the following:

1. Visit the problem statement which needs to be improved.
2. Change `task_view` in its url to `task_text`, in the browser address line, like this:
        www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/sum-of-two
        to
        http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_text/sum-of-two
3. After hitting `Enter` you should see the source text of the statement in `Markdown` format. Press `Ctrl-A` and `Ctrl-C` to select all and copy it.
4. Go to [Issues](https://github.com/CodeAbbey/Corrections/issues) of this project and click "new issue".
5. Enter the problem name or number as a `Title`, then in the description paste the source and remove everything except the fragment you want to be changed. Save it.
6. Now as issue is created, add another comment to it with the same fragment, but in the improved/corrected form.
7. When your improvement is added, the issue state is changed to "closed".

For example see this [demo issue](https://github.com/CodeAbbey/Corrections/issues/1), please.
